1. Problems encountered during implementation are deciding which way the tree should be
constructed. According to the requirements and video, each of the symbol’s trees should be
sorted according to the Lexicographical order. But when I tested some of the test cases that
were given to us, I found that the latter wasn’t the case. (An issue that I encountered are in shesells-encoded.txt, after rebuilding the tree I found that for instance, the letters ‘s’ and ‘e’ have
the same frequency, but they are not inserted according to their Lexicographical order)
2. the tree for the alpha and non-Alpha symbols. The problem was encountered with the right way
to delete the first 2 nodes, and then replace them with one T node that is used as the “sum” of
both frequency values.
3. Incomplete implementation and known bugs are the encoding strings for my characters. When I
use bigger file inputs, most of the encodings are wrong, with some of them correct. The process
worked on sea.txt but not on other text files
4. There were no significant interactions
